# Current Location and Framer Router

When navigating between pages on your Framer website, it is advised to use the useRouter hook from Framer to avoid breaking the navigation history. Additionally, the useCurrentLocation hook, built by the community, can be used.


1. [Use the Current Location](#useCurrentLocation)
2. [Use the Router and Route Id](#useRouter)



## Use the Current Location

```js
const [currentLocation, setCurrentLocation] = useCurrentLocation()
````
The `useCurrentLocation` hook functions similarly to the classic _useState_ React hook. It returns two variables: one for reading the current location and another for setting the current location:

- `currentLocation`: Returns a string representing the current relative path (e.g., _/contact_).
- `setCurrentLocation`: Navigates to the desired path (e.g., _setCurrentLocation("/contact")_).

e.g.:
```js
import { useCurrentLocation } from "https://framer.com/m/FramerDevGemsPublic-djHN.js"

function CodeComponent(props) {
    const [currentLocation, setCurrentLocation] = useCurrentLocation()

    return (
        <button
            onClick={() => {
                setCurrentLocation("/contact")
            }}
        >
            Contact Us
        </button>
    )
}
```

By default, the hook supports external URLs and routes outside of the Framer project. It will fall back on the classic `window.location.assign` method to redirect to unknown routes. You can use the `strict` flag to allow only available routes. e.g.:
```js
const [currentLocation, setCurrentLocation] = useCurrentLocation({strict: true})
```

## Use the Router and Route Id

```js
const { navigate, routes } = useRouter()
const routeId = useCurrentRouteId();
```
The useCurrentLocation hook is built on top of the two official Framer hooks: _useRouter_ and _routeId_.
- `routes`: An array containing all available routes in your website, sorted by their IDs.
- `navigate`: A function that allows you to navigate to the desired page by indicating the _routeId_.
- `routeId`: Returns the ID of the current page you are visiting.

e.g.:
```js
//@ts-ignore
import { useRouter, useCurrentRouteId } from "framer"

type Route = { path: string; [key: string]: any }
type Routes = { [key: string]: Route }
type RouteHook = [string | undefined, (path: string) => void]
type Params = { strict: boolean }

/**
 * React hook to get and set the current route location in a Framer project.
 * @param {Object} params - The parameters for the hook.
 * @param {boolean} params.strict - If true, the hook will enforce strict location matching.
 * @returns {[string, (string) => void]} - An Array with the current path and a Setter function
 * @example
 * const [location, setLocation] = useCurrentLocation();
 * setLocation('/about')
 * @docs - Refer to https://github.com/VictorienDotNet/Framer-Developer-Gems/blob/main/documentations/useCurrentLocation.md for futher details
 */
const useCurrentLocation = (params?: Params): RouteHook => {
    const { navigate, routes } = useRouter()
    const currentRouteId = useCurrentRouteId()

    const currentLocation = routes?.[currentRouteId]?.path

    const setCurrentLocation = (pathWithHash: string) => {
        const [path, hash] = pathWithHash.split("#")
        const routeID = Object.entries(routes as Routes)?.find(
            ([, value]) => value?.path === path
        )?.[0]

        if (routeID) {
            navigate(routeID, hash)
        } else if (!params?.strict) {
            window.location.assign(path)
        }
    }

    return [currentLocation, setCurrentLocation]
}

export { useCurrentLocation }
```
